Slides for my talk at the meeting of Oxford Open Science on Wednesday 22 August 2012.

Please note: this LaTeX document won't compile without my University of Bath beamer theme and the CSCT logo somewhere in your `texmf` path. If you want to reuse it, you'll need to use your own theme and remove the reference to the logo.
